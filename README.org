*Bash Scripts for Sprite Tilesets*

* Motivation
This little scripts were developped in response to a remark on one of QuillRaven's YouTube
videos about programming a game with Kotlin using libGDX, namely the one at the url
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Wlv_CizOY
* separate_frames.sh
** goal
Separate frames from a png sprite tileset into individual files
** example usage
~separate_frames.sh player.png 48x48 player/frame_~
-> will split the file =playe.png= into several png image files of dimensions =48x48=,
with names =player/frame_00=, =player/frame_01=,  ...
* namecopy.sh
** goal
  Copy some .png files named as =basename_xx.png=, where =xx= are numbers =00=, =01=, ...
  to a new base name and numbering such as newbase/name_y.png, ... NB: source assumed to
  use two digits for numbering, destination uses only one
** example usage
~namecopy.sh player_frames/frame_ 18 6 player/walk_front_~
-> will copy files =player_frames/frame_18.png= to =player_frames/frame_24.png=
into files =player/walk_front_0= to  =player/walk_front_5=
